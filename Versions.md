### Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Bugfix      14.16.1 -> 14.16.2 (patch)

Feature     14.16.2 -> 14.17.0 (minor, downward compatible)
