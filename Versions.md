### Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

Bugfix      14.16.1 -> 14.16.2 (patch)

Feature     14.16.2 -> 14.17.0 (minor, downward compatible)

Breaking    14.17.0 -> 15.0.0  (major)

### PrÃ¤fix Recomendation:
"feat:" -> Feature-Change: 14.16.2 -> 14.17.0
"feat!:" -> Feature, not downward compatible
"fix:" -> Bug-Fix or Patch
"fix!:" -> Bug-Fix or Patch,not downward compatible
"chore" -> clean up example: Remove some comments
"docs:" -> example: Update README.md
"refactor:" example rewrite function or class xyz
